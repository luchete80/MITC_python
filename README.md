Here's an improved and modernized version of your README with better formatting, icons, improved grammar, and the additions you requested (shear-bending coupling and drilling-membrane coupling). It’s structured to clearly highlight features, solver validation, and the upcoming course:

# 🧩 MITC Shells

**MITC Shells** is a finite element formulation based on MITC triangular (and later quadrilateral) shell elements, following the **Mixed Interpolation of Tensorial Components (MITC)** method by Dvorkin & Bathe (1984).

---

## ⚙️ Features

* ✅ MITC3 triangular shell elements (quads in progress)
* 🔁 Shear-bending coupling handled via MITC approach
* 🔄 Drilling-membrane coupling included
* 🧮 Displacement-based formulation
* 📊 Verified against ANSYS APDL and OpenSees

---

## 🚀 Solver Status

🔬 Developed as a lightweight **own FEM solver**.
🟢 **Results match ANSYS (Element 181)** for both bending and membrane tests.

---

### 📐 Bending with Transverse Load

🔎 MITC3 element with **shear locking correction** in local coordinates.
⚠️ Global rotation transformation is pending.

📌 Test Setup:

* 🔩 50N transverse load
* 📍 Nodes: (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1)

**Stiffness Norms**

```
Km = 3.8852e+11  
Kb = 3.2377e+07  
Ks = 3.0732e+10  
```

**Displacements (LOCAL):**

```
[UX, UY, UZ, RX, RY]
[0.0000  0.0000  0.0000  0.0000  0.0000]
[0.0000  0.0000 -1.3805e-06  3.0952e-08 -2.7300e-06]
[0.0000  0.0000  0.0000  0.0000  0.0000]
```

---

### 🧱 Membrane Behavior

📌 50N in-plane test.

**Displacements:**

```
[0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000]
[4.55e-09 0.0000 0.0000]
[0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000]

## 🌐 Global MITC3 Implementation

Work in progress on transforming local rotations and global element assembly.

---

## 📚 Upcoming Course

🎓 A **full course** is being developed to teach the implementation of MITC shell elements, covering:

* MITC3 triangle and quad formulations
* Shear and membrane behavior
* Handling of **drilling DOFs** and **membrane coupling**
* Real-world benchmarks and comparisons with commercial tools

💡 **Stay tuned** for launch info on [YouTube](#) and [Patreon](#) (links coming soon).
